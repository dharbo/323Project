## Files
There are 4 files:
    - finalp1.txt
    - part1.cpp
    - part2-3.cpp
    - part4.cpp

finalp1.txt contains the original program.

part1.cpp contains the program that removes comments and blank lines, and extra spaces.
It also writes the output to a new file called finalp2.txt.

part2-3.cpp contains the program that accepts or rejects the program from finalp2.txt based on the given grammar.
It also detects errors and displays corresponding error messages.

part4.cpp contains the program that translates the program from finalp2.txt to its C++ equivalent.
The new file is called part4-output.cpp.

## Order of Execution
First compile and run part1.cpp.

Then, compile and run part2-3.cpp.

Next, compile and run part4.cpp.

Finally, you may compile and run part4-output.cpp (the C++ version of the original program).
